## How to Play

The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible while shooting in the cowboys that appear in each wagon. The controls are simple:

- Use the W/A/S/D keys to move the character;
- Use the space bar to shoot.

You will notice an increase in the speed of the cowboy's bullets as you progress through each wagon. Be careful not to get hit by those, as it will result in loss of life. The game ends when your life bar becomes completely empty.
